This is the only official Issuu Plugin for Wordpress.

== Description ==

Issuu Embed simplifies the embedding of Issuu publications in blog posts, allowing you to copy/paste any publication URL from your browser into your blog post.

Note: This plugin is now the official Issuu plugin. The old plugin “wp-issuu” has been deprecated. Thanks to Tom Lynch for helping with this.

== Installation ==

Here's how to install the plugin and how to make it work.

1. Download and activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress admin
2. Copy Issuu publication URL from your browser and just paste it into the body of your post. Example: http://issuu.com/iscience/docs/issue23
3. If you are the owner of the publication on Issuu, you can use the link with the URL parameter e=xxxx/yyyy, which you get when sharing from the My Publications section on your Issuu account , to make use of styling options.

Make sure that the URL is on a separate line in your blog post.
